# RPA_Dummy_Applications
This project is a part of the RWTH-Aachen PADS group's RPA research.
This project is for testing commercial RPA products.
This test is at 2018.11.30

In this project, we adopted JAVA, .Net, and Web platforms to build three dummy applications.

In this three dummy applications, we add various components.
In the test we use Uipath, Kyron, and WinAutoMation, and this test is at 2018.11.30.

Firstly, we used these RPA product's recorded human behavior on these dummy applications.

Secondly, we replayed theses behavior on dummy applications.

Thirdly, we checked the RPA products' performance.

In the test, we found that different platform has strong effects on RPA products' performance.

Here is the result of recording.
√ means no error. 

"no" means unable to record.

"partial" means some components is able to record, but some could not.

Here is the result of replaying
√ means no error. 

"no" means unable to replay.

"backdoor" means there is no mouse or keyboard event when RPA products work.
